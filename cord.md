# *Cord : A programming language like C, but with classes and is not as bloated as C++.*

**Authors:** Joel Mathew (Nightshade).  
**Date:** December 2025

## **Abstract**

A programming language that combines the absolute low level control of C and ASM and adds classes to it so it can be use for a more wider spectrum of use cases.

## **Introduction**

This programming language is designed to allow people to have a OOP experience with C without all the bloat and excessive features that come with C++.

## "Hello World" in C:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

  printf("Hello World\n");
  
  return 0;
}
```

## "Hello World" in Cord:

```
#include <biosys.h>
 int main(){

  printf("Hello World!\n");

  return 0;
 }
```

<style>
  .link-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end; /* aligns content to the right */
    padding: 20px;             /* optional spacing */
    background-color: #333;    /* dark background */
  }

  .right-link {
    color: white;               /* makes the link white */
    text-decoration: none;      /* removes underline */
  }

  /* optional hover effect */
  .right-link:hover {
    text-decoration: underline;
  }
</style>
